This is a collection of gtk widgets I've made.  As i find the sources to them
i'll add them here.

gtkmodebutton

	This is a simple button that performs an action similar to a radio
	button.  It can have one active setting. However you are free to
	pack in many widgets (but there can be only one, highlander!).

	Sorry, that tv show ruled.

bdbliststore

	This is a GtkTreeModel implementation that uses a BDB database as the
	backend.  This allows for tuning how you want pages cached and what
	not on the database level.

	The current requirement is that the database is a DB_RECNO (a btree
	with auto-generated record nunbers, aka keys) and that it is created
	with the DB_RENUMBER option so that a record offset == key.

eggsqlitestore

	This is an old hack to make a GtkTreeModel that was backed by
	sqlite.  I made many more optimizations in other versions i wrote,
	but im not sure where they are at the moment. someday ill make
	this version better (when i decide that rdbms' don't suck)
