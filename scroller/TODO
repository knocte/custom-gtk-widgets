 * Code is ugly.
 * HScrollbar not implemented at all yet.
 * round the top and bottom of the scrollbars.
 * vscrollbar shouldn't reach to the bottom if hscrolling is needed
   (so they dont overlap. gtkscrolledwindow leaves a rectangle in the
   corner).
 * sometimes the fade in/out animations are clobbering or something and
   making the scrollbar disappear.
 * we should use an input only window for input actions above the child.
   gtkeventbox has an example of how to do this. this way, we can cache
   the rectangle for the current position of the scrollbar, and when the
   mouse hovers over it, allow clicking to drag-scroll.
 * Don't fade scrollbars out if in a pointer grab.
 * Need to determine now much gdk_window_move was by, so that we can invalid
   the existing area for the scrollbar.
